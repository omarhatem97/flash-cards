# Mobile Flash Cards

This App is built with react native (V5) and expo. It helps the users to memorize anything they want, for example, while studying. It has option to add decks, and add cards in these decks. Decks are saved locally so you don't have to worry about losing the data.

## Note

React native is very good at letting you write one code base and being able to run natively on android or ios, but please note that this app has been tested on Android only !

## install

type `npm install`
then type `expo start`
